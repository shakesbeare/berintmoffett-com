## About the Studio

I offer private lesson teaching trombone, cello, and music composition.
Students should expect to learn technical and artistic skills but also practice
techniques and performance etiquette.

Parents or guardians are welcome to sit in on lessons. For younger students,
this is encouraged so they can help the student stay on track during the week.

I believe that the best learning is done in a safe, comfortable environment. As
such, I constantly strive to make my lessons a place where students can be
themselves. Furthermore, I believe that we learn music fastest when we are
having fun. Therefore, I try to incorporate music and exercises that students
will enjoy in there lessons. 

I try to foster a relatable and down-to-earth atmosphere with my students. While
I will always remain professional, the teachers which have been the most
successful for me have been those that I was able to make friends with. 

## What to expect

Lesson experience varies greatly depending on age and intention, but in general
students should expect to be assigned homework to work on throughout the week
which will be critiqued in the next lesson. Students should also expect to learn
brand new skills in their lessons. The exact proportion of each depends on the
skill level and age of the student.

## Not sure?

As is standard, I offer a free 30-minute lesson to prospective students to
make sure it's a good match. Sometimes, it doesn't work out and that's okay!
The student-teacher relationship is very important for a healthy learning
environment.
