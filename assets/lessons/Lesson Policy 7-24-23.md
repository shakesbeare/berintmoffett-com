## Private Music Lessons

## About the Studio

I believe that the best learning is done in a safe, comfortable environment. As
such, I constantly strive to make my lessons a place where students can be
themselves. Furthermore, I believe that we learn music fastest when we are
having fun. Therefore, I try to incorporate music and exercises that students
will enjoy in there lessons. 

I try to foster a relatable and down-to-earth atmosphere with my students. While
I will always remain professional, the teachers which have been the most
successful for me have been those that I was able to make friends with. 

## Policies

### Lesson Payment

Lesson payments are non-refundable. It is preferred that students pay for
lessons by month, though this is not a requirement. If payment for a lesson is
not received in a timely manner, I reserve the right to consider the lesson
cancelled with no notice.

| Duration   | Cost |
| ---------- | ---- |
| 30 minutes | $30  |
| 45 minutes | $35  |
| 60 minutes | $40  |

### Cancellations

Lessons can be cancelled for no penalty as long as one day's notice is provided.
This means that I will work with you to reschedule a cancelled lesson or credit
it to the next month. If I cancel a lesson for any reason, it will always be at
no extra cost to you. 

If you cancel without giving requisite notice, the lesson fee is forfeit with no
reschedule or credit. Exceptions may be made due to extenuating circumstances at
my own discretion.

### Lateness

A lesson will be considered cancelled if the student is 15 minutes late or more
to a lesson. Lessons will end on time regardless of the time the student shows
up. 

If I am late to a lesson, I will ensure the student receives the full time paid
for, presuming both I and the student have time to do so. 

### Lesson Assignments

Students should make an honest effort to work on assigned material each week.
The exact expectation varies by student, but it is expected that some effort be
made. 

Private music lessons should *not* be a time to practice the material. Our time
is best spent learning new skills and critiquing the week's work. I will never
cancel a lesson due to unpreparedness, but know that an unprepared student has
wasted their money. 

### Location

I typically teach at either my home or at the College of Idaho, depending on my
schedule. If I have to travel to a lesson, I charge an extra $5 for the lesson.
The extra cost helps me cover gas but also allows me the freedom to block a
larger portion of my schedule on either side of the lesson for travel time.
